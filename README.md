#  Projects of Java

I created some projects in java because I am currently learning Java for android development and after I finish learning java I learn Kotlin and I am also learning Python for AI

  

##  Why I choose Java as my first language

  

The Reason of choosing Java is because I need staticly-typed object-oriented-programming (OOP) language I know there are my options like C Lang, C++ and etc... but I choose Java because first I learn fudamentals of programming then I started another

  

##  My next move

  

Programming Language that I learn after Java is C Lang and language after I learn C is C++ and then I learn Python for Machine Learning but I also learn DSA from <a  style="text-decoration: none"  href=""  target="__blank">@CodeWithHarry</a>

### Some Projects code:
#### Project 1 - Calculator:
```java
package  com.company;
import  java.util.Scanner;

public  class Calculator {

	public  static  void  main(String[]  args)  {
	// code
	Scanner  sc  =  new  Scanner(System.in);
	System.out.println("Enter the first value")
	int  n1  = sc.nextInt();

	System.out.println("Enter the second value")
	int  n2  = sc.nextInt();

	System.out.print("Operator: ")
	String  o  =  nextInt();
			switch  (o)  {
			case  "+"  -> System.out.printf("%d + %d = %d\n", n1, n2, n1+n2)
			case  "-"  -> System.out.printf("%d - %d = %d\n", n1, n2, n1-n2)
			case  "*"  -> System.out.printf("%d x %d = %d\n", n1, n2, n1*n2)
			case  "/"  -> System.out.printf("%d / %d = %d\n", n1, n2, n1/n2)
			default  -> System.out.printf("Not a operator\n")
		}
	}
}
```
## Output
~~~
Enter the first value
24
Enter the second value
2
Operator: *
24 x 2 = 48
~~~
# Why C after Java?

I am choosing C for DSA and for learning robotics and see these are my favorite programming languages here
| Programming Language | Favourite Percentages | Reason
|--|--|--|
| C Language | 100% | Because it's God Language|
| C++ Language | 100%| Because it's very hard|
| Java | 90%| Because of Designed very awesome|
| Kotlin | 50%| IDE for Kotlin looks professional   |
| Python| 80%| Used in Machine Learning|

## Some Task for you

Make a variable name it ``i`` and type
 ```java
for (i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
	System.out.println(i);
}
```
